I think that today was quite odd, because today wasn't odd (if that makes sense), as it usually was. Anyways...

In 1st period, we had our Literature Circle. Today's assignment was Literary Luminary and making questions (I forgot what the name was), so yay.

In 2nd period, we peer-edited our letters to the Prime Minister.

In 3rd period, we did almost the same thing as yesterday in music.

In 4th period, we had French, and we started our new title pages.

In 5th period we did our science PSAs, and I think that we got fairly far on ours, though we still have to make a _lot_ more edits.
