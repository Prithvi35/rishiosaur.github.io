Today was a fairly odd day (as usual), since we did quite a few things. In period 1, we had Music, where we practiced Song #40, San Sereni. This was to be our test song, so I have to practice for that. After this, we practiced our Winter concert songs, which were 'Good King Wencelas', 'Jingle Bells', 'Jolly Old St. Nicholas', 'Dreidel Song', and 'Kwanzaa Celebration'. We also practiced our Bâ™­concert scale.

In period 2 and 3, we worked on our PSAs, and I have to admit, we got pretty far on it. In the past few weeks, we were more focused on finding movie-making software, like iMovie. I rooted for iMovie, but the others (I'm not naming names) tried to find online software. In the end, we decided on iMovie. Our plan for these two periods were to divide the jobs up, letting 2 of us work on the research and two of us work on the movie. The research people finished off the paper storyboard, and we need to finish off the movie for it.

In period 4, we had Phys. Ed (Gym), and we had to perform our dances. Since the two other people in our group formulated the dance, they just taught us it. I pulled up the slideshow that our teachers made for the Elements Of Dance, and then we practiced... and practiced... and practiced. Finally, after what seemed like 20 hours (We were supposed to get 20 minutes!), we started the presentations. We went 2nd. I think that we did relatively well, considering the circumstances.

In the last period, period 5, we had a math period. We did geometry, in which we made shapes using stated parameters. We made a parallelogram and a triangle. Our teacher showed us a _really_ cool way to make a triangle with parameters using only a line and 2 circles.
