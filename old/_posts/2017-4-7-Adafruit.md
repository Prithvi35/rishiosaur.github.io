I love coding, but I also love circuits. They're the things that run our world, and without them, I wouldn't be able to code. Adafruit is a company that makes circuit boards, but not just in any regular way: they make Arduino stuff (Adadfruit Feathers are the Arduino alternative), and teach you 3d printing, as well as how to make your own projects. Their main focus is on Arduino, but their boards aren't restricted just to the common rectangles. They make sewable [and Arduino-IDE-compatible, as well as circular] boards, which are their FLORA and GEMMA boards. They also made something called NeoPixels. These are essentially RGB LEDs, but which can be modified to fit your needs. They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes.
