## Tracking. Control. Convienience.

These are the things that companies use to create products in our world today.

And sadly, like meek sheep, we decide to follow them.

Trading off our privacy for convienience, and pricing.

## Assistants.

Virtual Assistants are everywhere these days.

However, they are littered with proprietary software, and cannot be customized to any degree, other than by actual developers.

## Omega.

Omega aims to change some of those traits commmonly associated with virtual assistants, by being as open as possible; it runs off of HTML, CSS, and JS, 

in order for it to run on anyone's computer with no problems to extra packages being needed to be installed.
