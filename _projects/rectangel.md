description: A Functional CSS Library that actually makes sense.
moreinfo: CSS right now is a terrible idea. There are styles all over the place, and you have to constantly look at documentation for <b>everything</b>. Not a good idea, right? Well, RCTNGL brings Functional programming to the world of CSS, so that developers can focus on actually making code, rather than looking at docs.
